    <h2>Chicken Pot Pie Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      Here's w hat you'll need to make the best chicken pot pie of your life:
    </p>
    <h3>Chiken</h3>
    <p>
      Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into cubes) are ideal for making
      classic chicken pot pie.
    </p>
    <h3>Vegetables</h3>
    <p>
      This chicken pot pie recipe calls for the usual suspects: peas, carrots,
      onions, and celery. You could toss in some mushrooms or green peppers if
      you want to incorporate more veggies.
    </p>
    <h3>Butter and Flour</h3>
    <p>
      The chicken pot pie filling starts with a roux made with butter and
      all-purpose flour.
    </p>
    <h3>Seasonings</h3>
    <p>
      Achieve the perfect cozy flavor with salt, pepper, and celery seed. Of
      course, you can add more seasonings to suit your taste.
    </p>
    <h3>Broth and Milk</h3>
    <p>
      Chicken broth and milk add depth of flavor and help create a smooth and
      decadent chicken pot pie filling consistency.
    </p>
    <h3>Pie Crusts</h3>
    <p>
      You'll need two unbaked pie crusts. If you opt for the homemade route, you

      It's easier than you think to make a crowd-pleasing homemade chicken pot
      pie. You'll find the step-by step recipe below, but here's a brief
      overview of what you can expect:
    </p>
    <h3>Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>
      Boil the cubed chicken with the carrots, peas, and celery for about 15
      minutes. Drain and set aside. Cook the onions in butter until they're
      translucent, then stir in the flour and seasonings. Add the chicken broth
      and milk and simmer until the filling is thick.
    </p>
    <h3>Fill and Bake the Pie</h3>
    <p>
      Place the chicken-vegetable mixture in an unbaked pie crust. Pour the
      chicken broth mixture over it. Cover with the top crust, seal the edges,
      and cut slits in the top to allow the steam to escape. Bake until the
      pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Store Chicken Pot Pie</h2>

      Allow the pie to cool completely before storage. Wrap the cooled pie
